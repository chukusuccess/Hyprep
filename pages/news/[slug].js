              The Federal Government says it will expand on the implementation
              of the different areas of deliverables of the United Nations
              Environment Programme on the clean-up of Ogoniland and even extend
              the project beyond the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari’s
              administration. The Minister of State for Environment, Sharon
              Ikeazor said this at a Ministerial Press briefing held in Abuja .
              <br />
              The Hon. Minister noted that the Ogoni clean-up project is a
              priority project of the Buhari administration and that stronger
              institutions have been put in place to make it outlive the present
              administration and deliver on its mandate of remediating Ogoniland
              and restoring the livelihoods of the people.
              <br />
              ‘The Ministry is accelerating the remediation project, expanding
              on the livelihood program of the hydrocarbon impacted communities.
              Preliminary remediation activities had commenced in early 2018,
              and work is at various stages of the remediation processes, with
              successes despite delays encountered.
              <br />‘ The Honourable Minister of State disclosed that works on
              the remediation of impacted sites in the first and second batches
              of contracts have been completed on all most all the sites and
              certified successful by the Regulatory Agency. In 2019 contracts
              for 21 lots were awarded for remediation, these covered 12 of the
              65 listed sites in the UNEP report. These lots covered an area of
              276 acres. To date 18 of these lots have been completed and
              certified by NOSDRA. 3 of the lots are currently undergoing
              certification process and one lot is still undergoing remediation.
              An additional 29 lots were awarded for remediation of 8 sites in
              February 2020. The area covered is 289 acres. Six of these sites
              have been completed and certified by NOSDRA while two outstanding
              sites at B-Dere and Ogale are above 60% completion of which we are
              accelerating.

            As of January 2022, bidding for additional 37 hydrocarbon impacted
            sites is in progress. Total volume of contaminated soil to be
            remediated is 5,354,766 cubic meters over an area of about 314
            acres.’On the impact of the clean-up on the local economy, Ikeazor
            stated that several youths in the communities are gainfully employed
            at HYPREP sites and are working to earn
            <br />
            income as well as gain experience in the field of remediation. ‘The
            impacts of the remediation effort have produced remarkable
            employment and livelihood opportunities among Ogoni youths. So far,
            a total of one thousand three hundred and thirty-seven (1,337)
            persons have been trained, employed, and earned income to support
            their livelihood, thereby enhancing local economy. Both artisanal
            refiners and other youths are entitled to be given the opportunity
            to develop and expand their existing skills or acquire new skill
            sets to build their capacity and empowerment’.
            <br />
            In 2020, a set of 400 women commenced training by UNITAR in
            agribusiness at Songhai Farms in the areas of aquaculture, poultry,
            cropping and food processing. The plan is to train total of 1,200
            women in agribusiness. Needs Assessment forms were distributed to
            5000 youths in December 2021, to capture the choice skill sets of
            Ogoni Youths, Women and able Men as well as physically challenged
            people. These Needs Assessment forms are targeted at the artisanal
            refiners to provide them with alternative livelihoods through
            acquisition of new skillsets. 500 community youths will be employed
            as local security at various HYPREP sites in Ogoniland.
            <br />
            She maintained that in line with the UNEP report on the provision of
            potable water, HYPREP is expanding the scope of water to more
            communities in Ogoniland and that the results are already visible in
            communities where the taps are running or work still going-on.’In
            May 2021, contractors were mobilized to six (6) sites in Alesa
            Eleme, Ebubu and Nsisioken, Terrabo, Gokana, Barako/B-Dere/K-Dere,
            and have achieved significant progress. The communities in Alesa,
            Eleme Local Government Area, are now enjoying the provision of
            potable water supply.

            process for the design of the Centre of Excellence for Environmental
            Restoration along with an Integrated Contaminated Soil Management
            Centre has begun in line with UNEP recommendation.

            community in Nigeria, Chairman, Board of Trustees of HYPREP, Dr.
