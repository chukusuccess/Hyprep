              </h2>
              <p className="text-left">
                The Environmental Assessment Report released by the United
                Nations Environment Programme on the state of the Ogoni
                environment among other things recommends the health audit of
                residents exposed to hydrocarbon pollution to ascertain the
                effects of oil pollution on the health of the people. <br />
                Pursuant to this, the Honourable Minister of Environment, Dr
                Mohammad Mahmoud Abubakar was in Bori the Headquarters of Khana
                to flag-off the medical outreach put together by the Hydrocarbon
                Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP) for the four Local
                Government Areas of Ogoniland to collect health situation data
                as well as treat people suffering some health challenges.
                <br />
                Performing the flag-off at the General Hospital in Bori, Dr
                Abubakar said the on-going restructuring of HYPREP had ensured a
                steady speed in 2021 by bringing on stream other key
                recommendations and mandates of the UNEP Report”
                <br />
                The Honourable Minister reeled out the achievements recorded in
                the last few months to include; the commencement of Phase 1
                Contract for the provision of potable water in Ogoni
                communities, flag-off of the training of five thousand Ogoni
                youths for sustainable alternative livelihood, opening of Public
                Health Inventory, opening of bids for Environmental Surveillance
                and Construction of Centre of Excellence for Environmental
                Studies/Remediation, consultancy for the Environmental
                Surveillance and construction of the Integrated Contaminated
                Soil Management.
                <br />
                Dr Abubakar disclosed that the cleanup is gaining momentum
                following the completion of eighteen out of the twenty-one lots
                in the Phase 1 Batch 1 contracts, while five lots in Batch 2
                have been completed and undergoing NOSDRA certification process.
                On the training of the five thousand youths in alternative
                livelihood skills, the Honourable Minister revealed that the
                training will be based on their desired choice of occupation and
                not an imposition by HYPREP thus giving the youths engaged in
                artisanal refining the opportunity to turn a new leaf from the
                hazardous and illegal activity of artisanal refining.
                <br />
                The Honourable Minister during the commissioning of the HYPREP
                Local Government Area Office added that the Federal Government
                is bringing the project closer to the people of Ogoniand as a
                commitment to the implementation of UNEP Report with the
                involvement of Ogoni people’. He disclosed that HYPREP is
                constructing area offices across the four LGAs in Ogoniland. He
                assured the Ogoni people of standard work on the ongoing water
                project being undertaken in the phase 1 of the provision of
                potable water for Ogoni communities and water schemes located at
                ori/Kpea Water Scheme in Khana Local Government Area,
                Barako/B-Dere/K-Dere Water Scheme in Gokana Local Government
                Area, Korokoro/Nonwa Water Scheme in Tai LGA, Alesa, Alesa Water
                Scheme in Eleme Local Government Area and Ebubu/ Nsisioken/Ogale
                Water Scehem also in Eleme LGA.

              Dr Abubakar further disclosed that complex and semi-complex
              impacted sites in which groundwater remediation is required have
              been advertised for prequalification of companies and the bids
              opened to select competent companies for the work.
              <br />
              As part of measures to restore the damaged mangrove vegetation,
              the Honourable Minister for Environment announced the constitution
              of a joint team comprising professionals from Hydrocarbon
              Pollution Remediation Project (HYPREP), United Nations Environment
              Programme (UNEP), National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency
              (NOSDRA), the International Oil Companies (IOC’s), the Movement
              for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), KAGOTE and Civil
              Society Organizations (CSO), to undertake a pre-shoreline clean-up
              technique assessment of the mangrove sites damaged by artisanal
              refining. The measure, he said is in line with UNEP’s
              recommendation to stop re-pollution of remediated sites. According
              to him ‘the stoppage of re-pollution from oil spills and
              discharges is the pre-condition for clean-up of such areas that
              are liable to re-pollution, otherwise, it will be an exercise in
              futility.’ He appealed to community leaders and youths to be
              vanguards against artisanal refining and crude oil theft that
              constitute a major threat to the clean-up goal and reiterated the
              commitment of the President to seeing Ogoni clean after the
              clean-up.
              <br />
              Earlier in his remarks, Professor Philip Shekwolo, the Acting
              Project Coordinator of HYPREP stated that the health audit is one
              of the important programmes in the implementation of the UNEP
              Report and commended Ogoni youths on their support for HYPREP.
              <br />
              Goodwill messages were given by prominent Ogoni stakeholders
              including King G.N.K. Gininwa – the President of the Supreme
              Council of Ogoni Traditional Rulers, Celestine Akpobari a
              representative of the Civil Society on the Governing Council of
              HYPREP, Dr Mike Nwielaghi – HYPREP BoT Chairman among others.
              <br />
              Other activities carried out by the Honourable Minister was the
              commissioning of the HYPREP Area Office in Bori, flag-off of
              training of five hundred Ogoni youths in Basic Remediation
              Techniques and HSE and the inspection of the ongoing water scheme
